# HRG Lab Website

This is the website of the Huff Research Group website at Pennsylvania State University.

This website is powered by Jekyll and some Bootstrap / Bootwatch. It is based on the template from the Allan lab at Leiden University. The design has been modified to better reflect the color scheme of PSU.
